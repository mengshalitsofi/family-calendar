# Family calendar
This Sinatra-based Ruby Application is the second project for Flatiron School, created by Mengsha Li.

The purpose of this application is to allow a family to maintain its events, view events other family members created, etc.

## Getting Started
You might need to install the necessary gems first
  bundle install
To run the application
  shotgun
...and then point your browser to http://localhost:9393 to see the website.

## Application flow
The welcome page will allow users to log in or sign up. Once the users do that, they will be redirected to a page showing all the current events for the family.
Users will then be able to click on each event to see more details, and in case they are the owners of these events, they could delete/edit them.
